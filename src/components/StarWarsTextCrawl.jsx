                    Long ago, the four duties lived together in harmony. Then,
                    everything changed when scope creep attacked. Only the
                    full-stack engineer, master of all four duties, could stop
                    them, but when the world needed them most, they vanished. A
                    couple weeks passed and I discovered the new full-stack
                    engineer, a cool guy named Nick, and although his skills are
                    great, he's always eager to learn more. I believe he can
                    save us all...
